# ðŸ’«`Netflix clone`

Welcome to my Netflix clone project, This application is created using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The purpose of this project is to give users an experience similar to using Netflix, where they can browse, search, and watch a variety of movies and TV shows.

### Key Features

- **User Accounts**: Users can create accounts and log in. This feature allows them to have their own space with personalized options.

- **Movie and TV Show Listings**: The app shows a wide range of movies and TV shows. Users can easily scroll through different categories and see details like the title, description, and a poster image.

- **Search Function**: There is a search bar that helps users find specific movies or shows quickly. This makes it easier to explore content they are interested in.

- **Watch List**: Users can save their favorite movies and shows to a watch list, so they can easily find them later. This feature helps users keep track of what they want to watch.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work well on different devices, like computers, tablets, and smartphones. This means users can enjoy watching content wherever they are.

- **Streaming Simulation**: When users click on a movie or show, they can view more details. While the actual streaming feature is not included, the project simulates the experience of a streaming service.

### Technology Used

- **MongoDB**: This database stores user information and the content available in the app.

- **Express.js**: This framework helps in setting up the server and managing requests.

- **React**: This library is used to build the front end, creating a smooth and interactive user interface.

- **Node.js**: This is the environment that allows running JavaScript on the server side.

- **TMDB API**: This API is used to fetch real movie and TV show data, which adds richness and variety to the content available in the app.
